	Recommend 1

Have not done plotting the model tp show layers // will use matplotlib
Labeling of predicted element

Softmax activation function gives us the probabilities
Compiling the model simple means storing the model after traing it
Hot one encoding transforms the data to an array that has one where the value is and zero for rest
	us np_utils.to_categorical for y train and test to do that

Saliency visualization
	Example is a bird on a tree, how sure are we that the model is not associating the trees with birds?
